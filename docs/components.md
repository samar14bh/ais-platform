# AIS Platform — Component Reference

Every source file, its role, inputs, and outputs.

---

## Ingestion

### `ingestion/aisstream_producer.py`

Connects to the AISStream WebSocket (`wss://stream.aisstream.io/v0/stream`),
filters messages by type and bounding box, and publishes each position report as a
JSON string to Kafka topic `ais.raw.positions`.

Retry policy: exponential backoff on Kafka send failures (up to 5 retries).
WebSocket reconnect: automatic on close, every 5 seconds.

**Env vars:** `AISSTREAM_API_KEY`, `KAFKA_BROKER`, `AIS_FILTER_MESSAGE_TYPES`,
`AIS_BOUNDING_BOXES_JSON`

**Output:** Kafka `ais.raw.positions` — one message per AIS position report.

---

## Streaming jobs

All three jobs read from Kafka `ais.raw.positions` with a 10-second
`processingTime` trigger. The JSON schema used to parse messages is declared in
`stream/schema.py`. Shared SparkSession builders are in `stream/stream_utils.py`.

### `stream/job1_positions.py`

Writes each parsed position to two sinks:

- **Redis** `vessel:{mmsi}` — JSON string with latest position, TTL 5 min.
  Also maintains `vessel:active` sorted set (score = epoch ms) for fast
  active-vessel queries.
- **Cassandra** `ais.vessel_positions` — append-only insert, uses the vessel's
  own GPS timestamp (`MetaData.time_utc`) as `recorded_at`, falling back to
  processing time only if absent.

**Env vars:** `CASSANDRA_HOST`, `CASSANDRA_PORT`, `REDIS_HOST`

### `stream/job2_zone_aggregation.py`

Groups each micro-batch by Mediterranean zone (via `shared/zones.py`) and
computes average speed and vessel count per zone. Upserts one document per zone
into MongoDB `ais_db.zone_stats`.

Uses `outputMode("complete")` — the aggregation is over the full current batch,
not an accumulating window, so each trigger replaces the previous zone snapshot.

**Env vars:** `CASSANDRA_HOST`, `MONGO_USER`, `MONGO_PASSWORD`

### `stream/job3_anomalie_detection.py`

Detects two anomaly types per micro-batch and upserts alerts into MongoDB
`ais_db.alerts`:

- `vessel_stopped_at_sea` — speed = 0, nav_status not anchored/moored
- `abnormal_speed` — deviation from vessel profile exceeds 2 standard deviations

Vessel profiles are loaded from MongoDB `ais_db.vessel_profiles` with a 5-minute
in-memory TTL cache (`cachetools.TTLCache`). Alert deduplication uses a stable
`alert_id` = sha256(mmsi + type + 5-min wall-clock bucket).

**Env vars:** `CASSANDRA_HOST`, `MONGO_USER`, `MONGO_PASSWORD`

---

### `stream/job4_hdfs_archive.py`

Archives every parsed AIS position to HDFS as Parquet. This is the permanent
record — no TTL, no expiry. All other sinks (Redis, Cassandra, MongoDB) have
bounded retention; HDFS is the only one that keeps everything forever.

Reads the full parsed fields (not just the raw JSON string) so the Parquet files
are columnar and immediately queryable by Spark without a JSON parsing step.

Partition scheme: `year=/month=/day=/hour=` (Hive-compatible). A one-day query
scans only 24 hour directories, not the full dataset.

Uses a **60-second trigger** rather than the 10-second trigger used by jobs 1–3.
Archival is latency-insensitive; larger batches produce fewer, bigger Parquet files
which reduces NameNode metadata pressure and improves read performance.

Checkpoint stored on HDFS (`/ais/checkpoints/job4_hdfs_archive`) so Spark
resumes from the last committed Kafka offset after a container restart.

**Output path:** `hdfs://hdfs-namenode:8020/ais/vessel_positions/year=.../month=.../day=.../hour=.../`

**Env vars:** `KAFKA_BROKER`, `HDFS_NAMENODE`, `HDFS_PORT`

---

## Batch jobs

All jobs read vessel positions filtered to a single `BATCH_DATE` (defaults to
yesterday). The shared SparkSession builder and data readers are in
`batch/batch_utils.py`, which exposes three read functions:

| Function | Source | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `read_vessel_positions_for_date()` | Cassandra | Data within the 30-day TTL window |
| `read_vessel_positions_from_hdfs()` | HDFS Parquet | Data older than 30 days |
| `read_vessel_positions_auto()` | Either | Automatically chooses based on date |

All three return identically shaped DataFrames so batch job code needs no
conditional logic. The Cassandra path uses partition key pushdown; the HDFS
path uses Parquet partition pruning. Both avoid full scans.

### `batch/batch_job_d_vessel_profiles.py`

**Run first.** Computes per-vessel speed statistics (mean, std dev, max,
observation count) from the target day's positions. Writes one document per MMSI
to MongoDB `ais_db.vessel_profiles` (upsert).

Used by stream job 3 for abnormal-speed detection.

### `batch/batch_job_a_routes.py`

Extracts common shipping route segments by encoding each position as a geohash
(precision 5, ~5 km), computing consecutive cell transitions per vessel, counting
occurrences, and discarding transitions longer than 200 km (GPS noise filter using
a Haversine UDF). Writes to MongoDB `ais_db.route_segments`.

### `batch/batch_job_b_zone_traffic.py`

Aggregates traffic per zone per hour and per day. Writes to
`ais_db.zone_traffic_hourly` (one doc per zone-hour) and
`ais_db.zone_traffic_daily` (one doc per zone-date, including peak hour).

### `batch/batch_job_c_heatmap.py`

Encodes positions at two geohash precisions (5 = ~5 km, 6 = ~1 km), counts
messages and unique vessels per cell, computes log-normalised intensity (0–1).
Writes to `ais_db.heatmap_tiles_p5` and `ais_db.heatmap_tiles_p6`.

### `batch/run_batch_jobs.sh`

Shell script used by the `spark-batch-scheduler` container cron job. Runs jobs
D → A → B → C in order, passing `BATCH_DATE` to each `spark-submit` invocation.
Logs success/failure for each job.

### `batch/export_cassandra_to_csv.py`

Utility script. Exports `ais.vessel_positions` (full table or a single date if
`EXPORT_DATE` is set) to a single CSV file in `batch/exports/`. Used to produce
`cassandra_vessel_positions_all.csv`. Not part of the normal pipeline.

---

## Backend

### `backend/main.py`

FastAPI application served by Uvicorn on port 8000.

Database clients are cached with `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)` — one MongoClient and
one Cassandra session are reused across all requests.

| Endpoint | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | — | Liveness check |
| `GET /api/live/vessels` | Redis | Removes stale entries (> 10 min) before responding |
| `GET /api/alerts` | MongoDB `alerts` | Sorted by timestamp desc, limit 50 |
| `GET /api/zone-stats` | MongoDB `zone_stats` | Current snapshot per zone |
| `GET /api/zone-traffic/{period}` | MongoDB `zone_traffic_hourly` or `_daily` | `period` = `hourly` or `daily` |
| `GET /api/heatmap` | MongoDB `heatmap_tiles_p5` | All tiles for latest date |
| `GET /api/routes` | MongoDB `route_segments` | All segments for latest date |
| `GET /api/vessels/{mmsi}/trajectory` | Cassandra | Last N positions for the vessel |
| `WS /ws/live-traffic` | Redis | Pushes full vessel list every 1 second |

---

## Frontend

### `frontend/src/App.tsx`

Root component. Owns the WebSocket connection lifecycle, global vessel state,
selected vessel, and view toggle (dashboard vs. traffic insights). Throttles
incoming WebSocket messages to 200 ms to avoid excessive re-renders.

### `frontend/src/api.ts`

Typed fetch wrappers for every REST endpoint. Base URL from
`VITE_API_BASE_URL` env var (default `http://localhost:8000`). WebSocket URL
is derived automatically (`http` → `ws`, `https` → `wss`).

### `frontend/src/types.ts`

TypeScript interfaces matching the backend JSON shapes: `ShipData`, `Alert`,
`ZoneStat`, `HeatmapTile`, `RouteSegment`.

### `frontend/src/components/`

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Header.tsx` | Top bar with KPI chips (vessel count, avg speed, feed status) |
| `Sidebar.tsx` | Left panel: vessel search, recent alerts, layer toggles |
| `VesselMap.tsx` | Leaflet map: vessel markers, popups, heatmap overlay, route polylines |
| `VesselDetail.tsx` | Right panel: selected vessel metadata and trajectory trail |
| `TrafficInsightsPage.tsx` | Full-screen analytics view with zone charts and stats tables |
| `ZoneTrafficChart.tsx` | Recharts line/bar charts for zone traffic trends |
| `HeatmapToggle.tsx` | Leaflet.heat integration; toggle from sidebar |
| `RouteFlowLayer.tsx` | Weighted polylines from route_segments data |

---

## Shared utilities

### `shared/zones.py`

Single function `get_zone(lat, lon) -> str` that maps a coordinate to one of the
eight Mediterranean zone names. Used by stream job 2 (as a Python UDF registered
in Spark) and batch job B.

---

## HDFS

### `config/hadoop.env`

Environment variable file consumed by the `hdfs-namenode` and `hdfs-datanode`
Docker containers (via `env_file`). Uses the `apache/hadoop:3.3.6` image's
convention of `CORE-SITE.XML_` and `HDFS-SITE.XML_` prefixed env vars, which
the image's entrypoint converts into the corresponding XML configuration files
at startup.

Key settings:
- `fs.defaultFS = hdfs://hdfs-namenode:8020` — all Hadoop and Spark clients
  resolve `hdfs://` URIs to this address
- `dfs.replication = 1` — single DataNode; no replication overhead in dev
- `dfs.namenode.safemode.threshold-pct = 0` — exits safe mode immediately on
  startup instead of waiting for replication targets to be met

### `docker/spark/entrypoint.sh`

Shell script set as the Docker `ENTRYPOINT` for the Spark image. At container
startup it reads `HDFS_NAMENODE` and `HDFS_PORT` from the environment and
writes `$SPARK_HOME/conf/core-site.xml` so the Hadoop client embedded in Spark
knows where the NameNode is. Then it hands off to the command from
`docker-compose.yml` (`exec "$@"`).

This approach is used instead of baking a static hostname into the image so the
Spark containers work regardless of what the NameNode is called.

Also includes `dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname=true` which is required when
HDFS DataNodes are accessed by hostname from outside their container network
(Docker bridge network name resolution).

---

## Configuration and infrastructure

### `config/cassandra_schema.cql`

CQL file applied once at setup. Creates the `ais` keyspace
(replication factor 1), the `vessel_positions` table, and the `batch_job_runs`
audit table. Must be applied before any streaming or batch job runs.

### `docker-compose.yml`

Defines all services. Infrastructure services (kafka, cassandra, redis, mongodb,
minio) start unconditionally. Application services (backend, spark-*, stream-*,
ingestion-producer, spark-batch-scheduler) require `--profile full`.

Service health dependencies:
- `stream-job1` waits for `cassandra: service_healthy` and `kafka: service_healthy`
- `stream-job2`, `stream-job3` wait for `kafka: service_healthy` and `mongodb: service_healthy`
- `backend` waits for `redis`, `cassandra`, `mongodb`

### `docker/ingestion/Dockerfile`

Python 3.11-slim image. Installs `requirements-ingestion.txt`. Runs
`python -m ingestion.aisstream_producer`.

### `docker/spark/Dockerfile`

`apache/spark:3.5.0` base. Installs `cron` (for the batch scheduler) and
`requirements-spark.txt`.

### `batch/crontab`

```
0 2 * * *  /opt/spark-jobs/batch/run_batch_jobs.sh
```

Fires `run_batch_jobs.sh` at 02:00 UTC daily. The script runs D → A → B → C in
order. Loaded into the `spark-batch-scheduler` container at startup.

### `scripts/init_mongo.js`

Idempotent MongoDB initialisation. Creates the eight collections in `ais_db` and
their indexes if they do not already exist. Run once after first boot via:

```powershell
$id = (docker compose ps -q mongodb).Trim()
docker cp scripts\init_mongo.js ${id}:/tmp/init_mongo.js
docker compose exec mongodb mongosh "mongodb://admin:admin@localhost:27017/admin?authSource=admin" /tmp/init_mongo.js
```

### `scripts/load_csv_to_cassandra.py`

One-shot loader for `cassandra_vessel_positions_all.csv`. Uses the `cqlsh COPY`
approach inside the Docker container (see START.md section 1.5) because
`cassandra-driver` does not support Python 3.12+.
